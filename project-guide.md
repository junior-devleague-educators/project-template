### Tips and Suggestions

- Try to incorporate school spirit or modern trends into projects to keep students engaged.
- Include links to images or assign tutorials prior to assigning the project to solify concepts covered in the project.

- Encourage students to use Slack to ask questions and or send resources they've found.
- Use the **Hawaii Educators in Technology** Slack for ideas or assistance in creating projects.
- Feel free to draw inspiration from open source resources online like GitHub, w3schools, Stack Overflow, Medium.com, and Jr.Devleague's github https://github.com/junior-devleague. 
- Always add stretch goals for students who get ahead.
- If students finish projects early have them help other students who are still completing their projects. 
- If projects are more advanced, you may want to include a screenshot of the finished project to help guide students in their development process.
- Be clear in your instructions, if it's a bigger project, make sure students wire-frame or map out their ideas first and then stick to that plan to complete their MVP.
- For projects that are more visual, have students create a GitHub page to showcase their work.

### Reference Repos
- Feel free to create informative repos in GitHub for reference. 
- Include link to reference repos within the project.
- Reference repos should be informative, descriptive, and should include as many visuals possible to help students practices development processes and workflows.
